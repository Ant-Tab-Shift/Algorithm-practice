# [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

Given a string `s`, return *the longest* a **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string in `s`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "babad"
**Output:** "bab"
**Explanation:** "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "cbbd"
**Output:** "bb"

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

**Follow-up:** You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n^2) time
